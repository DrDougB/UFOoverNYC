# UFOoverNYC

This repository documents Dr. Buettner's analysis of the "UFO over NYC" UAP that was initially posted on Reddit.
The analysis was performed on behalf of Enigma Labs and Mr. Ben Hansen and attracted significant news media attention.

If you have an X.com (formerly Twitter) account, you can listen to a recording hosted by Enigma Labs where we discussed this sighting.

(NOTE: First time I had ever been on that platform and as such I had significant audio connection difficulties!)
